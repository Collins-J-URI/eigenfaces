This application demonstrates the use of an ImageWarper.THe window contains two subwindows.  The first one shows the input image overwhich is overlaid a rectangular warping grid.  The right subwindow allows the userto displace the warping grid points and also display the output (warped)image.  Clicked on (or very close to) a grid point selects it (color changesfrom blue to red).  Clicking on new, desired point location results in a warpingof the image.
