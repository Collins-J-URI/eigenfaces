  This simple program demonstrate the use of a RasterImage object as a       destination for a movie being played and processed.                      																			   o The upper-left quadrant displays the video's current frame               o The upper-right quadrant displays a the gradient of the current frame        overlaid on a gray-level copy of that frame                            o The lower-left quadrant displays the norm of the gradient                o The lower-right quadrant displays a saturated color copy of the              current frame (not particularly useful, but add a a pretty note of         color to the display).
