This project demonstrates the use of the BackgroundRemover classes (here
used to compute image differences).	
  o the upper left and upper right subwindows show the input images
  o the lower-left subwindow shows the difference image calculated
      using the "AVERAGE_DIFFERENCE" mode and the image difference
      static function of the BackgroundRemover parent class
  o the lower-right subwindow shows the difference image calculated
      using the "MAX_DIFFERENCE" mode and the background removal
      function (after setting the first image as static background)																		|
