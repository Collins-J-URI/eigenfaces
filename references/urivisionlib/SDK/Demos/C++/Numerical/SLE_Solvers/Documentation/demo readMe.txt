This project demonstrates the use of the basic classes for solving systems of linear equations:
   - basic square SLE: by LU factorization
   - positive definite square SLE: by Choleski factorization
   - basic overdetermined SLE: QR factorization 
   - [nasty SLE: by Singular Value Decomposition] --> not coded yet

I output the results to a text file that I can read in Mathematica, Maple, Matlab, Scilab, or any other fine application for doing Mathematics on a computer.
