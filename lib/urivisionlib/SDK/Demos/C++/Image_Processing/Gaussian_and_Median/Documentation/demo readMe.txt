//  o The upper-left quadrant shows the input image
//  o The upper-right quadrant shows a gray-level copy of the input image
//  o the lower-left quadrant shows the effect of applying a Gaussian
//      filter to the gray-level image (right-click menu selection)
//  o the lower-right quadrant shows the effect of applying a Median
//      filter to the gray-level image (right-click menu selection)
//
//  Note [12/10/05]:    The implementation of the MedianFilter class is 
//     still embarassingly inefficient.  This is just a quick hack that
//     gets the basic functionality, and then I moved on to another
//     needed-right-now class and never got around to finishing this one.

//  Version 1.2 [12/10/05]  jyh, 3DG
//        cleanup and uniformization with other demos
