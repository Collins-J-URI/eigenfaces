   This demo application shows how to use the overlay functions of the        RasterImage class.                                                         o The upper-left subwindow shows a color image                             o The upper-right subvwindow shows a gray-level image                      o The lower-left subwindow shows the result of overlaying small images         (gray-level or color) on the upper-left image                          o The lower-right subwindow shows the result of overlaying small images        (gray-level or color) on the upper-right image                      																				The user can move the "sprite" images by use of the arrow keys when in     "relative" overlay mode (an origin is specified for the upper-left         corner of the sprite's valid data rectangle.                               The user can switch from "absolute" (the sprite's valid data rectangle     determines the location in the image) to  "relative" (the location in the
   destination image is determined by the origin variable) display modes by        hitting the space bar.                                                  Still to be done: - cleanup of the copy/write into/from float and HSV rasters
