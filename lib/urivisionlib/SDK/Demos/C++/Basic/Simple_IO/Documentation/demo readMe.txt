This project demonstrates the use of the basic Image and RasterImage classes.
Several RasterImage objects are either created from a char array or read from an
image in the tga or ppm/pgm/pbm formats.  The user can cycle through the images
by hitting the '[' and ']' keys or through (glut) menu selections.
