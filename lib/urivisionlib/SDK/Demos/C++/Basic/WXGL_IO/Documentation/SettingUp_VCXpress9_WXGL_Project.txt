This document describes how to use VisualStudioExpress9 with wxWidgets

SVN:

Add the following global definitions (all three lines merged into one) to the start of the SVN Global ignore pattern
RtClk\TortiseSVN\Settings...Subversion...Global ignore pattern

*.aux *.dvi *.idx *.ilg *.ind *.log *.lof *.lot *.out *.toc 
*.ilk *.user *.manifest mt.dep *.pdb *.idb *.obj *.lib *.exe BuildLog.htm
*.o *.lo *.la *.al .libs *.so *.so.[0-9]* *.a *.pyc *.pyo *.rej *~ #*# .#* .*.swp .DS_Store

Install VisualStudioExpress9 for VC.
{Microsoft Platform SDK for Windows Server 2003 R2 had been needed for VSE8-2005 but does not seem to be needed now:)

Add xxxBase variables to Environment Variables (CtlPanel->System->Advanced::EnvironmentVariables)
--- add these to System variables
--- seems like it works better to put trailing '\' in the variable definition
--- must restart VCexpress after adding these vars:(
UriVisionBase == C:\uriVisionLib\
WxWidgetsBase == C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\
ProjectsBase  == C:\Projects\
GLutBase      == C:\Projects\glut-3.7.6\
WinPSdkBase   == C:\???

Setup wxWidgets for OpenGL support

Set 
// Recommended setting: 1 if you intend to use OpenGL, 0 otherwise
#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS       1
in file C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\include\wx\msw\setup.h
{there is same setting in C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\include\wx\setup_inc.h but it appears that the file C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\include\wx\setup_redirect.h points MSW to use the directory C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\include\wx\msw\}

then recompile wx libraries using C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\build\msw\wx.dsw
rebuild 
{let VC convert them since these are prior to VC9}


For each project

Start VCexpress
Create: Project --> Visual C++ ... emptyproj
Enter name: fred, Location C:\Projects, Solution Name: fred, Check create dir for soln

Create dir C:\Projects\fred\Sources  
< just copy MonoSim_Base\Docs, MonoSim_Base\Resources, & MonoSim_Base\Sources to new dir, then rename files

base files are

MonoSim_App.cpp,.h
MonoSim_canvas.cpp,.h
MonoSim_frame.cpp,.h
MonoSim_menus.cpp,.h

expect to rename all MonoSim_xxx to NEW_PROJ_xxx; do the classes too:)
<Use NotePad++ to rename all BOM_Formatter to newname>

edit add files and change names there too.

put .cpp and .h files in \Sources to keep them separate from other junk VCx creates in ...\fred

add .cpp files to Source Files folder in project, .h files to Header Files folder
>

Create dir C:\Projects\fred\Resources
pur any .rc file in \Resources
put .XPM type files in in \Resources

DO THIS FOR BOTH THE DEBUG AND RELEASE CONFIGURATIONS
<\start set properties>
Right click on FRED --> Properties <Linker::Input::Additional Dependencies>
For Win32 Platform SDK, add libraries 
comctl32.lib
rpcrt4.lib
shell32.lib
gdi32.lib
kernel32.lib
user32.lib
comdlg32.lib
ole32.lib
oleaut32.lib
advapi32.lib

For wxWidgets projects:
Add $(WxWidgetsBase)include;$(WxWidgetsBase)include\msvc to C++ includes list <C/C++::Additional Include Directories>
Add $(WxWidgetsBase)lib\vc_lib; to linker search list <Linker::General:::Additional Library Directories>

For OpenGL projects
Add $(GLutBase)include to C++ includes list <C/C++::Additional Include Directories>
Add $(GLutBase)lib to linker search list <Linker::General::Additional Library Directories>


For uriVisionLib projects:
Add ...tbd...
